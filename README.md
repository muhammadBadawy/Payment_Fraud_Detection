Training a linear model to do credit card fraud detection.
Then Improve the model by accounting for class imbalance in the training data and tuning for a specific performance metric.

This case will demonstrate how to use supervised learning techniques, specifically SageMakerâ€™s LinearLearner, for fraud detection.

The payment transaction dataset we'll work with is unbalanced, with many more examples of valid transactions vs. fraudulent, and so we will investigate methods for compensating for this imbalance and tuning your model to improve its performance according to a specific product goal.

Then Adding on to what you have learned in the credit card fraud case study, you will learn how to manage cases where classes of data are not separable by a linear line. You'll train and deploy a custom, PyTorch neural network for classifying data.
